# Human-Pose-Estimation-and-Detection-Group-9-
The primary motivation of this project is to develop a robust, human pose detection system deployable on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, enabling efficient edge-based inference for real-world scenarios. Beyond achieving embedded performance, the project also emphasizes to improve pose detection accuracy for individuals with unique scenarios.
